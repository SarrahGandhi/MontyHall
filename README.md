# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

This is a simple implementation of the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. In this simulation, you will choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car üèéÔ∏è, and behind the others are goats üêê. The game provides you with the option to either stick with your initial choice or switch after a goat door is revealed.

## Features

- **Choose a door**: Click on one of the three doors.
- **Reveal a goat**: After selecting a door, a goat door will be revealed.
- **Switch or Stay**: After revealing the goat, you can choose to switch your selection or stay with your initial choice.
- **Result**: The game will display whether you won a car or a goat.
- **Play Again**: You can play the game again after each round.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**: Three doors are displayed, each labeled "Door 1", "Door 2", and "Door 3".
2. **Make a Selection**: Click on one of the doors to make your initial selection.
3. **Reveal Goat**: The system will automatically reveal a door that has a goat behind it (not your selected door and not the car door).
4. **Switch or Stay**: After revealing a goat, you will have the option to switch your choice or stick with your original pick.
5. **Show Results**: Once you finalize your choice, the door with the car is revealed, and the game will show whether you won the car or a goat.
6. **Play Again**: After the result, you can click "Play Again" to restart the game.
